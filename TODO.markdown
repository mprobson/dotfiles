vimrc
- May need some tweaks after using (like taking bang off au and expanding for .ci)

makesymlinks.sh
- change replace and replace2 to more descriptive names OR combine two replace functions!
- remove echos, thanks to set -x
- make this re-entrant
  - for instance, check if dirs/files already exist

gitignore
- automate based on gitignore.io scripts and platform
